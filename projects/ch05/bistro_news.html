    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
</article>

<p>Posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</p>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide.</dfn> 
In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to.
<br> In thei book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching<br/></p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><em>Sous Vide</em> Salmon with dill Hollandise.</b> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.</p>

<p>Location: <br>
Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA
</p>

<p>Hours: <br>
Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to 11pm
